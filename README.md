- Hi, I’m @idelovski
- 👀 I’m interested in C programming on both Mac & Windows (and ObjC on iOS/Mac)
- Now I work on my MacOS app that needs transition from 32 bit Carbon to 64 bit Cocoa, but in fact I'll try to make it reuse at least some of of its Carbon history, like MENU and DITL resources that I render myself with NSMenu, NSMenuItems and NSControls of different kind
- 🌱 I was learning how to effortlessly and with simplest code access web services, process json and xml in plain C. Now, most of what I needed is working quite well. Managed to have a similar routines to access xml or json elements with strings similar to xpath - "start.names[2].name" and so far it works with all xml and json buffers I have tested.
- 🌱 And I have a layer that helps me use MySQL mostly without SQL. I have struct descriptions that describe type and size of fields inside so my code creates all necessary SQL for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT (with LEFT JOIN if needed) so in the end I use real SQL strings only for special cases not covered by my main routines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different C and Objective C projects
- 📫 How to reach me - my guthub handle on both gmail and yahoo.
